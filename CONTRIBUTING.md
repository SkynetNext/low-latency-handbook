# Contributing to Low Latency Handbook

We welcome contributions to keep this handbook accurate and up-to-date!

## How to Contribute

1.  **Correcting Data**: If you find any inaccuracies, please provide a link to a reliable source (academic paper, official vendor whitepaper, or reproducible benchmark results).
2.  **Adding New Data**:
    *   Place the detailed data in the appropriate file under `docs/`.
    *   If it's a critical metric, add it to the summary table in `README.md`.
    *   Always include the hardware/software environment details used for the measurement.
3.  **Improving Documentation**: Clarity and formatting improvements are always welcome.

## Data Source Priority

We prefer data in the following order:
1.  Official Architecture Manuals (Intel/AMD/ARM).
2.  Peer-reviewed Research Papers.
3.  Official Whitepapers from reputable vendors (Samsung, Mellanox, etc.).
4.  High-quality engineering blogs (e.g., Mechanical Sympathy, ItHare).

## Updating README.md

If you update the summary table, please ensure the "Cycles" column is recalculated for a **3GHz CPU baseline** to maintain consistency.
